<p>By day it’s the unloved Brixton market caff Express, but when night falls it lays out some jaunty tablecloths, turns on the soft lights and cranks up the Serge Gainsbourg to become L’Express, offering fine French vegetarian cuisine.</p>
<p>I had puy lentils with red onion to start - a bit of orange in the lentils gave it a wonderful sweet tang. This was followed by a winter platter of cheese and potato, potato and cheese, cheese and pastry and potato dishes with a little salad on the side to give it some colour. It was buttery and creamy and divine. My dining partner had a spicy coconut and lentil soup followed by purple curry which was much lighter than my choice. One item on the menu (which I’ll be having next time) is Chef’s Surprise. That’s it. No more detail. I bet it’s fantastic.</p>
<p>It was the best restaurant meal I’ve had this year and probably the best vegetarian food I’ve ever had. Starters are £4-5, mains are £8-10 and it’s BYO (there’s a fine wine shop opposite).</p>
<p>It’s in Market Row, the less popular adjunct to Brixton Village (where you’ll find Honest Burgers, KaoSarn and Brick Box). From the two places I’ve eaten here the food in Market Row is just as good, if not better, and it’s way less crowded. We were the only diners in L’Express on Saturday night but I’m told it was much busier on Thursday and Friday. Either way, go soon in case they pack it all in. They’re like that, the French.</p>
