<p>I think I hear &ldquo;we want a twitter account&rdquo; now more often than &ldquo;we want a microsite&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s the new cri de coeur for teams who think they&rsquo;re different from the rest of the organisation, and who feel that the existing comms aren&rsquo;t reaching their audience or generating the donations, signups or registrations they require.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to roll your eyes and think &ldquo;here comes another one&rdquo; when someone asks for their own Twitter account, but every now and then it&rsquo;s a genuinely good idea. So how do you work out if the latest request is silly or sensible?</p>
<p>As of last week (when I had three separate Twitter requests from three different teams) I ask them to fill in a little form I put together. This serves four purposes:</p>
<ul><li>It filters out the people who don&rsquo;t want to invest any time in actually getting their Twitter account off the ground (they&rsquo;re terrible clients anyway).</li>
<li>It gives people an idea of the effort and responsibilities involved in creating and maintaining a successful Twitter presence.</li>
<li>It gets people to think about topics they probably haven&rsquo;t considered, like software, passwords and training.</li>
<li>It provides you with the information required to make a judgement about whether they require a separate Twitter account and what support they might need.</li>
</ul><p>You can download a copy of the form here:<br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ng5y7gahcrd6yuj/So%20you%20want%20a%20Twitter%20account.docx" target="_blank">So, you want a Twitter account? (.docx)</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d appreciate any feedback on the form. Do you like it? Might you even use a copy of it yourself? How would you change it? Add a comment here or email <a href="mailto:jameshiggott@gmail.com">jameshiggott@gmail.com</a>.</p>
