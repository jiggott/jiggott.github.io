These are some things I’ve enjoyed in 2015.

## Podcasts

### Favourite podcast
It’s been going for several years, but 2015 was the year that I succumbed to [Answer Me This podcast](answermethispodcast.com) with Helen and Olly (and Martin the soundman). The laughs are frequent, the chemistry between the presenters is wonderful and the advice they give is sage.

### Favourite new podcast
Welcome back to podcasting, [Adam Buxton](http://adam-buxton.co.uk/ad/category/adam-buxton-podcast/). It is a medium that was made for you.

### Favourite podcast episode
It’s difficult to pick between the [Bradbury Building episode of 99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/on-location/) and the [Josef Mengele episode of Caustic Soda](http://causticsodapodcast.com/2015/09/14/josef-mengele/). Both are wonderful in their own way.

## Music

### Favourite new band
[Slug](http://www.slugband.co.uk/)

### Favourite old band
Todd Rundgren – I still can’t stop listening to [A Wizard, a True Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Wizard,_a_True_Star).

### Favourite gig
Slug at the Lexington were tons of fun, Super Furry Animals at Brixton Academy were blissful, but Television at Green Man festival – a band I love and one I never thought I would see live – has to be my musical highlight of 2015.

### Favourite album of 2015
[Orphaned Deejay Selek 2006-2008](https://bleep.com/release/61781-afx-orphaned-deejay-selek-2006-2008) because new Aphex is always an event.

### Favourite song of 2015
[Luke Vibert spiral staircase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNx7kxtVdQI) from the user48736353001 Soundcloud account. This dump of previously unreleased Aphex Twin tunes was also the most unexpected musical event of 2015.

### Favourite old song
According to last.fm the song I listened to most often in 2015 was [Let It Bleed by Goat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn9Li6Sh9BU). That’s a surprise but it’s a great song.

## Books

After dabbling with a Kindle for a few years, I mostly read dead-tree books in 2015.

### Favourite novel I read in 2015
[Night and the City](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/948618.Night_and_the_City) by Gerald Kirsch.

### Favourite comic book I read in 2015
[Three](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20638282-three) by Kieron Gillen.

### Favourite non-fiction book I read in 2015
[The Geek Manifesto: Why Science Matters](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13630458-the-geek-manifesto) by Mark Henderson.

### Favourite book that was actually published in 2015
[Seveneves](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22816087-seveneves) by Neal Stephenson.

## Films

### Favourite film from 2015
Whiplash is pretty much a perfect film and was my favourite from 2015. Mad Max: Fury Road and What We Do In the Shadows were fantastic too. And, importantly, Star Wars passed the don’t-be-shit test.

### Favourite old film that I watched in 2015
Chinatown (1974).

### Film I am most looking forward to in 2016
I am really quite excited for High Rise. Ballard!

## Places and events

### Favourite holiday
Who knew that Northumberland is one of the most beautiful parts of the UK? I had an amazing time there, I only wish it were a bit closer to where I live.

### Favourite day out
Helping at the Abbotsbury swan round-up is possibly the best thing I did in 2015.

### Favourite exhibition
[Ai Weiwei](https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/ai-weiwei) at the RA was fantastic, as was the Deutsche Börse prize at the Photographers’ Gallery (in particular [Ponte City](http://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/mikahel-subotsky-patrick-waterhouse) by Mikhael Subotzky and Patrick Waterhouse). However, my favourite exhibition was the educational, entertaining and incredibly well-designed [Forensics: the anatomy of crime](http://wellcomecollection.org/forensics) at the Wellcome Collection.

### Favourite news story
Jeremy Corbyn becoming leader of Labour. I have no idea whether he can win a general election in 2020 but at least we will have an effective (and interesting) opposition for the next few years. And he does seem to be inspiring a more people-powered version of politics.

### Favourite work-related news story
The birth of [NHS Alpha](http://digital.nhs.uk). I’ve been saying for years that the NHS should do something like this.

### Biggest loss
RIP Terry Pratchett.

## Projects and activities

### Best new activity
I started several new things in 2015 – drawing, running, climbing, badminton, Python, a yet-to-be-published blog about Crystal Palace – but didn’t really stick with or complete any of them. I must consolidate in 2016.

### Favourite project at work
I produced a couple of big pieces of work (an [animated infographic of election pledges](http://election.kingsfund.org.uk/pledges/) and an [alternative guide to mental health care](http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/alternative-guide-mental-health-care-england)) and we won four Digital Impact awards for our election work. However, the thing I’m most proud of is [this blog about NHS.UK](http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/blog/2015/08/will-nhsuk-be-next-govuk) &ndash; the communications team does not traditionally write blogs, so pitching this, having it accepted and then writing it was quite out of the ordinary.

### Favourite project at home
I built our Christmas tree ([details here]({% post_url 2015-12-19-homemade-wooden-christmas-tree %})).
