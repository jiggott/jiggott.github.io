<p>Unless you work for one of the larger non-profits, the chances are you’re in quite a small digital team. In fact, it might just be you managing digital communications for your organisation.</p>
<p>It’s all too easy to find yourself trapped in a little digital bubble - you’re the only expert in this area, you don’t have other people with whom to bounce ideas around, people who’ll send you links to interesting campaigns or invitations to new sites which are only just in beta. What you lack is people who’ll challenge you, help you learn more, hone your skills and become better at your job.</p>
<p>Luckily though, the not-for-profit sector is the friendliest and most sharingest place I’ve ever worked. Your peers in other organisations want to share what they’re doing, and hear about what you’re doing and offer feedback. They’ll suggest tools or contacts or suppliers who can help you. Very often they’ll even share their data so you can benchmark how you’re doing.</p>
<p>Yes, charities compete with one another for donations but there’s a feeling among us that because we’re all working for the greater good we want to help one another out. And if everyone maintains that attitude it can only benefit the sector as a whole.</p>
<p>So, where to find your counterparts in other organisations…?</p>
<h2>The first place to look is Twitter</h2>
<p>They are all over Twitter. Find @howardlake, follow him, then look at his <a href="https://twitter.com/howardlake/lists/charity-digital-socmedia-19/members">Charity Digital and Social Media list</a> - there are more than 300 people on that list who do similar jobs to you and who LOVE to tweet about it.</p>
<h2>Next, join some forums</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&amp;gid=2448787">Digital Fundraising Forum</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&amp;gid=4383311">CharityComms Heads of Digital</a> LinkedIn groups are both very active, as is probably the longest-standing online group for us people: the <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/charitywebforum/info">Charity Webmasters Forum Yahoo Group</a>.</p>
<p>The Institute of Fundraising has <a href="http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/groups/">regional groups</a> which are great places to network, and the <a href="http://insightsig.org/">Insight</a> and <a href="http://www.ioftech.org.uk/">Technology</a> special interest groups are of particular relevance to our discipline.</p>
<p>Depending on your interests, you may want to check out <a href="http://fairsay.com/networks/ecampaigning-forum">eCampaigning Forum</a>, a worldwide community of people using digital for campaigning, or <a href="http://wonkcomms.net/">WonkComms</a>, a blog/group/Twitter account for comms people in think tanks.</p>
<h2>You can also attend one of the many free meetups</h2>
<p>You have to be quick off the mark to get a ticket for two of the most popular meetups, <a href="https://twitter.com/NFPtweetup">NFP Tweetup</a> and <a href="http://barcampnonprofits.com/">Barcamp NFP</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://digitalcharities.org/">Digital Charities</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/digitalFRforum">Digital Fundraising Forum</a> both run really good workshops, focusing on a different topic each time.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Charitymeetup?src=hash">Charity Meetup</a> and the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-Charity-Workers-Meetup/">London Charity Workers Meetup</a> are networking events attended by all parts of the charity sector.</p>
<p><a href="http://open-charity.org/">Open-Charity</a> is specifically for charities using open source software. <a href="http://attending.io/events/drinkingaboutmuseumssept2014">Drinking About Museums</a> has more of a museumy angle but is open to all sectors.</p>
<p>The prize for the meetup with the best/worst name goes to <a href="http://charitychap.com/slamdunc/">SLAMDUNC</a>, the South London Area Mega Digital Unconference (although there hasn’t been one of these since March 2015). <a href="http://socialmediaweek.org/london/">Social Media Week</a> in London each September is also worth checking out as it has had some great charity-specific events in the past.</p>
<p>If you can afford to pay a little bit of money to attend a conference, workshop or seminar, check out the programmes of events run by <a href="http://www.charitycomms.org.uk/events">CharityComms</a> and the <a href="http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/events-and-training/iofevents/">Institute of Fundraising</a>.</p>
<h2>Benchmarking has grown loads in the last few years</h2>
<p>If you love your data and you want to know if your comms and campaigns are actually performing well in comparison to other organisations, you need to take part in one of the benchmarking projects.</p>
<p>The most ambitious of the lot is probably the <a href="http://www.charitycomms.org.uk/charitycomms-digital-benchmark">CharityComms Digital Benchmark</a>. It combines Google Analytics data with survey responses to build a detailed snapshot of charities’ performance online, although it’s not . There are other surveys I’ve taken part in over the years on specific subjects like email or social media. Keep your eye on Twitter and the forums and you’ll hear about them.</p>
<p>With all of these, the full results are only available to the participating organisations, so you have to give a little to get something back.</p>
<h2>We&rsquo;re a friendly lot</h2>
<p>People who do similar jobs to you at other nonprofit organisations actively want to help you succeed. We have a vibrant, open community of digital professionals, and if you engage with it you’ll find that you get a lot out of it.</p>
<h2>Missed anything?</h2>
<p>I’m bound to have forgotten a particular group or event, so I apologise now. Tweet me at <a href="https://twitter.com/jiggott">jiggott</a> and I’ll add yours.</p><p>Originally posted August 2014, updated March 2016.</p>
