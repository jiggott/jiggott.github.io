<p>I&rsquo;ve just finished reading <em>Leading Digital Transformation: Recommendations for Charity Chief Executives</em> (by Katie Smith, Alex Morrison and Fay MacDonald). I&rsquo;ll be passing it around others in my organisation.</p>
<p>There are six recommendations in the paper, some more relevant to us than others. Some of them we are already working towards, others are new  concepts we&rsquo;ve not discussed before. For me, the report is confirmation that we are doing the right thing as well as some practical ideas about how we can do the right thing a bit better. It&rsquo;s also that valuable weapon in your armoury for when you need to convince your bosses about something - someone else&rsquo;s opinion, preferably an impartial someone.</p>

<p>To give you a flavour of its content, here are some of the passages I highlighted:</p>
<blockquote>Plans for digital operations that do not allow for growth rates of at least 20% per year may look like underestimates.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Digital managers in Third Sector organisations described how a lack of digital literacy across their organisations is manifesting itself in a tendency towards unrealistic expectations and a lack of prioritisation and focus.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Digital strategy is not separate from corporate strategy. It is about taking a conscious view of how online technologies can help the business to improve, whether that is reaching more people, delivering services in new ways, or raising more money.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Leaders need to equip themselves and their teams with enough knowledge to be able to make business-critical decisions about investment in digital.</blockquote>
