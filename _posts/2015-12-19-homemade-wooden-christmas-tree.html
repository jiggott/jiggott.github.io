<p>This year I saw a photo of a wooden Christmas tree that someone had made using a pallet and thought ‘I can do that’. So I did. I now have a handmade wooden Christmas tree which will last for many years and of which I am ridiculously proud. Here are the steps I took:</p>

<p>I picked this old bed frame off the street in Penge a few months ago. I knew it would come in handy!</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/xmas-tree-2.jpg" alt="Wooden slats" /></figure>
<p>I smashed it up into bits.</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/xmas-tree-3.jpg" alt="Wooden cross" /></figure>
<p>I attached the slats to a pole from an estate agent sign.</p>

<p>I cut the shape of a tree with a jigsaw.</p>

<p>I painted it, built a simple base to make it stand upright and inserted some small shaker pegs into the back of the slats to make it easier to hang decorations.</p>

<p>All it needs now are some decorations.</p>
