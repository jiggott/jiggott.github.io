<ul><li>A quantity of fat, black sloes</li>
<li>1 bottle gin</li>
<li>White sugar</li>
</ul><p>Wash the sloes thoroughly and prick them through with a needle to release the juice. Drink one third of the gin and, if you are now in any fit state, continue thus.</p>
<p>Put enough sloes in the bottle to reach one third of the way up. If you have a sweet tooth add four tablespoons of sugar, if you are a more aesthetic drinker two will do.</p>
<p>Seal tightly and shake every day until Christmas. If you collect your sloes in October this will do very well for the macerating period must not be less than three months.</p>
<p>Damson gin or mulberry gin, which is absolutely gorgeous, may be made in the same way but there is no need to prick the latter. Sloes and damsons may also be transformed in the same way with a bottle of vodka.</p>
<p>These alcoholic potions get better the longer you keep them but chance, as they say, would be a fine thing.</p>
