<p>Today I attended Justgiving’s Impact through innovation conference. Topics ranged from social media to the 21st century to mobile to volunteering to in-mem giving. Here are eight things I learned:</p>
<h2>1. Most people haven’t seen a good Vine video yet</h2>
<p>I asked five people this question and only one replied in the affirmitive. Vine is very new so that’s not too surprising. Serendipitously, <a href="https://twitter.com/LondonKirsty" target="_blank">@LondonKirsty</a> chose today to share her Storify collection of good charity Vines: <a href="http://storify.com/londonkirsty/i-heard-it-on-the-grape-vine" target="_blank">I heard it through the Grapevine</a>.</p>
<h2>2. You can launch a campaign on Twitter before it goes out on posters, TV, etc</h2>
<p>This is what BHF did for the #hardandfast campaign with Vinnie Jones and the results were so successful they’d do it again like that. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/DaraNasr" target="_blank">@DaraNasr</a> for that.</p>
<h2>3. JustGiving encourages a share after every action</h2>
<p>Make a donation, set up a page, add content to your page, even edit your post-donation comment and JustGiving will ask you to share far and wide, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/jon_bedford" target="_blank">@jon_bedford</a>.</p>
<h2>4. There’s a Facebook Page Manager app</h2>
<p>It works on iPhone and Android and it’s more powerful than the page management tools in their regular app.</p>
<h2>5. Lucy Buck from Child’s I (<a href="https://twitter.com/childsi" target="_self">@childsi</a>) is worth listening to</h2>
<p>I only caught the first ten minutes of her talk but I got two gems from it:</p>
<ul><li>Giving love is just as valuable as giving time or money</li>
<li>Storytelling 101: set up problem (beginning), offer way to help (middle), show result (end)</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. <a href="http://phonecount.com/" target="_blank">Phonecount.com</a> is a very cool website</h2>
<p>It’s also very useulf if you need to convince people about the value of mobile. Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/barryoreilly" target="_blank">@barryoreilly</a> for that.</p>
<h2>7. It’s possible to have a mobile-only user journey</h2>
<p>This would involve an SMS or a donation SMS to start, regular outbound SMS comms and regular giving through your phone bill. Most user journeys will be mobile and something else but mobile-only is possible. Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/helenjpattinson" target="_blank">@helenjpattinson</a> for that.</p>
<h2>8. Don’t silo your in-mem supporters</h2>
<p>They often want to do challenges or events in memory of someone, as well as funeral collections or donations in lieu of flowers. In fact, 38% of in-mem donors skip the funeral collection / flowers thing altogether. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/tea_junkie" target="_blank">Katie Simmons</a> for that.</p>
