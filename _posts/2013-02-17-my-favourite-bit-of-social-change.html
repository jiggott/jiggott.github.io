<p>I go through Elephant and Castle Shopping Centre every now and then, frequently to catch a late train back to Herne Hill. It’s not a very pleasant space – it’s dirty, dimly lit, empty and more than a bit seedy. I’m not surprised they’re knocking it down.</p>
<p>There are some good things about it of course – Mamuska is a good Polish restaurant and the bowling alley on the top floor does proper bowling instead of drinking, dancing and karaoke with a bit of bowling on the side – but only the helpless nostalgics will be sad to see it go.</p>
<p>At some time last year though, it changed. Groups of people (the youth!) started hanging around inside the building. There was a low-level murmur of chit-chat and excitement and the unmistakable sound of ball pinging off bat, onto table and onto bat again (or floor). Someone had installed some table tennis tables.</p>

<p>The tables were <a href="http://www.sportengland.org/about_us/our_news/table_tennis_streets.aspx" target="_blank">paid for by Sport England</a> and started appearing in London in 2010 as part of their attempt to get more people playing sport regularly. An increase in ping pong is not, I expect, how most people would have interpreted that particular bit of Olympic legacy but it is a sport, and an Olympic sport at that. It’s also something that pretty much anyone can do and have fun while doing it.</p>
<p>Sport England was responsible for getting 1,000,000 more people playing sport three times a week and it was way off target, so much so that they scrapped their old target and set a more achievable one. They still needed a quick win though, and what better than to install some tables, equip them with bats and balls and then sit back and count the participants? Ping!, the organisation behind the tables, believes that <a href="http://www.sportengland.org/media_centre/press_releases/ping_results.aspx" target="_blank">30,000 people played on average four times each</a> (during an unspecified period using not-very-rigorous methods for counting).</p>
<p>What does it matter if the motivation behind them is a tiny bit cynical though? The important thing is that they injected some fun into the capital. Most of them were put in already-fun, Hipster-friendly spots around east London like 93 Feet East, Arnold Circus and London Fields but they were also installed in quite rough locations like Haggerston Park and Camberwell Green.</p>
<p>Now that the Ping! project has run its course many of the tables were sent elsewhere, to places like Elephant and Castle shopping centre. As I walked through there today on my way home from band practice two young men (one short, one tall) were playing a very intense game while half a dozen others looked on and waited their turn. Do they play winner stays on? I don’t know - I had a train to catch.</p>
<p>Those table tennis tables have brightened up a dark little corner of London. They bring people together, they make places more friendly, they increase participation in sport and they helped make a frankly depressing place a little more joyful. I hope when the shopping centre goes a new home is found for them.</p>
<p>(I’m pleased to see that Ping! has been <a href="http://www.sportengland.org/about_us/our_news/ping_nominated_for_sport_indu.aspx" target="_blank">nominated for Sports Participation Event of the Year</a> in the Sport Industry Awards 2013. I hope it wins.)</p>
