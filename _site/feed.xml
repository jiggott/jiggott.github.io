&lt;h2 id=&quot;podcasts&quot;&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-podcast&quot;&gt;Favourite podcast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second year running, it’s &lt;a href=&quot;answermethispodcast.com&quot;&gt;Answer Me This podcast&lt;/a&gt; with Helen and Olly (and Martin the soundman). I’m finally caught up with the back catalogue and it has been a lot of fun doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-new-podcast&quot;&gt;Favourite new podcast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wnyc.org/shows/anxiety&quot;&gt;The United States of Anxiety&lt;/a&gt; was a first-rate piece of audio journalism, a window into America in the run-up to the US presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-podcast-episode&quot;&gt;Favourite podcast episode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Walker’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://toe.prx.org/2016/07/because-theres-nothing-else-to-do/&quot;&gt;Because there’s nothing else to do&lt;/a&gt; captured the feeling of listlessness and disorientation that many people felt after the Brexit vote. On a more whimsical note, shout out as well for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07q7lzc&quot;&gt;Things Called Jazz That Are Not Jazz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tortoise - I was disappointed by The Catastrophist but it led to me exploring their back catalogue a bit more and coming across some things I had missed over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-gig&quot;&gt;Favourite gig&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kvelertak at the Electric Ballroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-album-of-2016&quot;&gt;Favourite album of 2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nattesford by Kvelertak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;books&quot;&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-novels-that-i-read-in-2016&quot;&gt;Favourite novel(s) that I read in 2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/series/112239-southern-reach&quot;&gt;The Southern Reach&lt;/a&gt; trilogy by Jeff Vandermeer. If Ballard did The X Files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-comic-book-that-i-read-in-2016&quot;&gt;Favourite comic book that I read in 2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/series/140991-southern-bastards&quot;&gt;Southern Bastards&lt;/a&gt; by Jason Aaron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-non-fiction-book-that-i-read-in-2016&quot;&gt;Favourite non-fiction book that I read in 2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow&quot;&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/a&gt; by Daniel Kahneman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;films-and-telly&quot;&gt;Films and telly&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-film-from-2016&quot;&gt;Favourite film from 2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/best-of-2015/&quot;&gt;This time last year&lt;/a&gt; I was most excited for High Rise but my favourite films of 2016 were ones that I knew nothing about until I saw them in the cinema: Hunt for the Wildepeople was funny and poignant, and Arrival was sci-fi at its best – complex, abstract ideas explored in a speculative but believable setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-old-film-that-i-watched-in-2016&quot;&gt;Favourite old film that I watched in 2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django Unchained (2012). OK, it’s not that old but it is a far superior film to the actually hateful The Hateful Eight, which I saw at the beginning of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-tv-from-2016&quot;&gt;Favourite TV from 2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;House of Cards continues to be brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;places-and-events&quot;&gt;Places and events&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-holiday&quot;&gt;Favourite holiday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long weekend in Wales with people I don’t see all that often was probably my highlight, not least because we stopped off for a swim at Southerndown Beach on the way home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-exhibition&quot;&gt;Favourite exhibition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barbican.org.uk/artgallery/event-detail.asp?ID=17922&quot;&gt;Strange and Familiar&lt;/a&gt; – photos of Britain by international photographers – was excellent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-news-story&quot;&gt;Favourite news story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two stories about bots and AI really caught my imagination: &lt;a href=&quot;http://insight.welovesalt.com/post/102da8p/is-twitter-just-a-platform-of-hate&quot;&gt;DeepMind beating Lee Sedol at Go&lt;/a&gt; and Microsoft’s AI chatbot &lt;a href=&quot;http://insight.welovesalt.com/post/102da8p/is-twitter-just-a-platform-of-hate&quot;&gt;turning from teenage girl to Hitler-loving sex robot&lt;/a&gt; after just 24 hours’ exposure to Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-work-related-news-story&quot;&gt;Favourite work-related news story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Sustainability and Transformation Plans&quot;&gt;STPs&lt;/abbr&gt;. I think they’re a good thing but they need time and space and money to succeed, all of which are in short supply these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;biggest-loss&quot;&gt;Biggest loss&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Bowie? Muhammad Ali? Carrie Fisher? We lost many people this year but I’ll pick &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_Cox&quot;&gt;Jo Cox&lt;/a&gt; as the biggest loss, partly because of the terrible nature of her death and partly because her best work was most likely ahead of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;projects-and-activities&quot;&gt;Projects and activities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure I consolidated any of the activities I said I ought to in my &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/best-of-2015/&quot;&gt;best of 2015 blog post&lt;/a&gt; last year. I did publish the &lt;a href=&quot;https://crystalpalacegrubcrawl.com/&quot;&gt;Crystal Palace Grub Crawl blog&lt;/a&gt; but I only managed nine posts. None of the places I’ve reviewed have closed down though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;best-new-activity&quot;&gt;Best new activity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve started a new band with a guitarist friend. We have some tunes, a singer and a plan to head into the studio by March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-project-at-work&quot;&gt;Favourite project at work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve started a full-scale redesign/rebuild of kingsfund.org.uk. I’ve also done some interesting work making the case for long-form content, the analytics/metrics of which I describe in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wonkcomms.net/2016/04/07/long-form-metrics-what-to-measure-and-how-to-measure-it/&quot;&gt;this blog post for Wonkcomms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-project-at-home&quot;&gt;Favourite project at home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Codeacademy and autodidacticism I now know just enough about Git, Sass and Jekyll to be dangerous. Rebuilding jameshiggott.co.uk has been a really interesting challenge for me. The look and feel is nowhere near where I want it to be, but I’m quite happy with the technical architecture and version control practices I’ve put in place.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html">These are some things I’ve enjoyed in 2016.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Best of 2015</title><link href="https://jameshiggott.co.uk/2015/best-of-2015/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Best of 2015" /><published>2015-12-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2015-12-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jameshiggott.co.uk/2015/best-of-2015</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jameshiggott.co.uk/2015/best-of-2015/">&lt;p&gt;These are some things I’ve enjoyed in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-podcast&quot;&gt;Favourite podcast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been going for several years, but 2015 was the year that I succumbed to &lt;a href=&quot;answermethispodcast.com&quot;&gt;Answer Me This podcast&lt;/a&gt; with Helen and Olly (and Martin the soundman). The laughs are frequent, the chemistry between the presenters is wonderful and the advice they give is sage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-new-podcast&quot;&gt;Favourite new podcast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to podcasting, &lt;a href=&quot;http://adam-buxton.co.uk/ad/category/adam-buxton-podcast/&quot;&gt;Adam Buxton&lt;/a&gt;. It is a medium that was made for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-podcast-episode&quot;&gt;Favourite podcast episode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to pick between the &lt;a href=&quot;http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/on-location/&quot;&gt;Bradbury Building episode of 99% Invisible&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://causticsodapodcast.com/2015/09/14/josef-mengele/&quot;&gt;Josef Mengele episode of Caustic Soda&lt;/a&gt;. Both are wonderful in their own way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;music&quot;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-new-band&quot;&gt;Favourite new band&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slugband.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Slug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-old-band&quot;&gt;Favourite old band&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd Rundgren – I still can’t stop listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Wizard,_a_True_Star&quot;&gt;A Wizard, a True Star&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-gig&quot;&gt;Favourite gig&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slug at the Lexington were tons of fun, Super Furry Animals at Brixton Academy were blissful, but Television at Green Man festival – a band I love and one I never thought I would see live – has to be my musical highlight of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-album-of-2015&quot;&gt;Favourite album of 2015&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bleep.com/release/61781-afx-orphaned-deejay-selek-2006-2008&quot;&gt;Orphaned Deejay Selek 2006-2008&lt;/a&gt; because new Aphex is always an event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-song-of-2015&quot;&gt;Favourite song of 2015&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNx7kxtVdQI&quot;&gt;Luke Vibert spiral staircase&lt;/a&gt; from the user48736353001 Soundcloud account. This dump of previously unreleased Aphex Twin tunes was also the most unexpected musical event of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-old-song&quot;&gt;Favourite old song&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to last.fm the song I listened to most often in 2015 was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn9Li6Sh9BU&quot;&gt;Let It Bleed by Goat&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a surprise but it’s a great song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;books&quot;&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dabbling with a Kindle for a few years, I mostly read dead-tree books in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-novel-i-read-in-2015&quot;&gt;Favourite novel I read in 2015&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/948618.Night_and_the_City&quot;&gt;Night and the City&lt;/a&gt; by Gerald Kirsch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-comic-book-i-read-in-2015&quot;&gt;Favourite comic book I read in 2015&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20638282-three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/a&gt; by Kieron Gillen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-non-fiction-book-i-read-in-2015&quot;&gt;Favourite non-fiction book I read in 2015&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13630458-the-geek-manifesto&quot;&gt;The Geek Manifesto: Why Science Matters&lt;/a&gt; by Mark Henderson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-book-that-was-actually-published-in-2015&quot;&gt;Favourite book that was actually published in 2015&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22816087-seveneves&quot;&gt;Seveneves&lt;/a&gt; by Neal Stephenson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;films&quot;&gt;Films&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-film-from-2015&quot;&gt;Favourite film from 2015&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whiplash is pretty much a perfect film and was my favourite from 2015. Mad Max: Fury Road and What We Do In the Shadows were fantastic too. And, importantly, Star Wars passed the don’t-be-shit test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-old-film-that-i-watched-in-2015&quot;&gt;Favourite old film that I watched in 2015&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinatown (1974).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;film-i-am-most-looking-forward-to-in-2016&quot;&gt;Film I am most looking forward to in 2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really quite excited for High Rise. Ballard!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;places-and-events&quot;&gt;Places and events&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-holiday&quot;&gt;Favourite holiday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knew that Northumberland is one of the most beautiful parts of the UK? I had an amazing time there, I only wish it were a bit closer to where I live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-day-out&quot;&gt;Favourite day out&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helping at the Abbotsbury swan round-up is possibly the best thing I did in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/abbostbury.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Three people holding swans&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-exhibition&quot;&gt;Favourite exhibition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/ai-weiwei&quot;&gt;Ai Weiwei&lt;/a&gt; at the RA was fantastic, as was the Deutsche Börse prize at the Photographers’ Gallery (in particular &lt;a href=&quot;http://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/mikahel-subotsky-patrick-waterhouse&quot;&gt;Ponte City&lt;/a&gt; by Mikhael Subotzky and Patrick Waterhouse). However, my favourite exhibition was the educational, entertaining and incredibly well-designed &lt;a href=&quot;http://wellcomecollection.org/forensics&quot;&gt;Forensics: the anatomy of crime&lt;/a&gt; at the Wellcome Collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-news-story&quot;&gt;Favourite news story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Corbyn becoming leader of Labour. I have no idea whether he can win a general election in 2020 but at least we will have an effective (and interesting) opposition for the next few years. And he does seem to be inspiring a more people-powered version of politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-work-related-news-story&quot;&gt;Favourite work-related news story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The birth of &lt;a href=&quot;http://digital.nhs.uk&quot;&gt;NHS Alpha&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve been saying for years that the NHS should do something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;biggest-loss&quot;&gt;Biggest loss&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIP Terry Pratchett.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;projects-and-activities&quot;&gt;Projects and activities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;best-new-activity&quot;&gt;Best new activity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started several new things in 2015 – drawing, running, climbing, badminton, Python, a yet-to-be-published blog about Crystal Palace – but didn’t really stick with or complete any of them. I must consolidate in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-project-at-work&quot;&gt;Favourite project at work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I produced a couple of big pieces of work (an &lt;a href=&quot;http://election.kingsfund.org.uk/pledges/&quot;&gt;animated infographic of election pledges&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/alternative-guide-mental-health-care-england&quot;&gt;alternative guide to mental health care&lt;/a&gt;) and we won four Digital Impact awards for our election work. However, the thing I’m most proud of is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/blog/2015/08/will-nhsuk-be-next-govuk&quot;&gt;this blog about NHS.UK&lt;/a&gt; – the communications team does not traditionally write blogs, so pitching this, having it accepted and then writing it was quite out of the ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-project-at-home&quot;&gt;Favourite project at home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built our Christmas tree (&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/homemade-wooden-christmas-tree/&quot;&gt;details here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

So I did. I now have a handmade wooden Christmas tree which will last for many years and of which I am ridiculously proud. Here are the steps I took:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/xmas-tree-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bed frame&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked this old bed frame off the street in Penge a few months ago. I knew it would come in handy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/xmas-tree-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wooden slats&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I smashed it up into bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/xmas-tree-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wooden cross&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attached the slats to a pole from an estate agent sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/xmas-tree-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Skeleton of tree and jigsaw&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cut the shape of a tree with a jigsaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/xmas-tree-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Christmas tree in living room&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I painted it, built a simple base to make it stand upright and inserted some small shaker pegs into the back of the slats to make it easier to hang decorations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All it needs now are some decorations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Projects" /><summary type="html">This year I saw a photo of a wooden Christmas tree that someone had made using a pallet and thought ‘I can do that’.

&lt;p&gt;Unless you work for one of the larger non-profits, the chances are you’re in quite a small digital team. In fact, it might just be you managing digital communications for your organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s all too easy to find yourself trapped in a little digital bubble - you’re the only expert in this area, you don’t have other people with whom to bounce ideas around, people who’ll send you links to interesting campaigns or invitations to new sites which are only just in beta. What you lack is people who’ll challenge you, help you learn more, hone your skills and become better at your job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily though, the not-for-profit sector is the friendliest and most sharingest place I’ve ever worked. Your peers in other organisations want to share what they’re doing, and hear about what you’re doing and offer feedback. They’ll suggest tools or contacts or suppliers who can help you. Very often they’ll even share their data so you can benchmark how you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, charities compete with one another for donations but there’s a feeling among us that because we’re all working for the greater good we want to help one another out. And if everyone maintains that attitude it can only benefit the sector as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, where to find your counterparts in other organisations…?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The first place to look is Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are all over Twitter. Find @howardlake, follow him, then look at his &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/howardlake/lists/charity-digital-socmedia-19/members&quot;&gt;Charity Digital and Social Media list&lt;/a&gt; - there are more than 300 people on that list who do similar jobs to you and who LOVE to tweet about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next, join some forums&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&amp;amp;gid=2448787&quot;&gt;Digital Fundraising Forum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&amp;amp;gid=4383311&quot;&gt;CharityComms Heads of Digital&lt;/a&gt; LinkedIn groups are both very active, as is probably the longest-standing online group for us people: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/charitywebforum/info&quot;&gt;Charity Webmasters Forum Yahoo Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Institute of Fundraising has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/groups/&quot;&gt;regional groups&lt;/a&gt; which are great places to network, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://insightsig.org/&quot;&gt;Insight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ioftech.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Technology&lt;/a&gt; special interest groups are of particular relevance to our discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your interests, you may want to check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://fairsay.com/networks/ecampaigning-forum&quot;&gt;eCampaigning Forum&lt;/a&gt;, a worldwide community of people using digital for campaigning, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://wonkcomms.net/&quot;&gt;WonkComms&lt;/a&gt;, a blog/group/Twitter account for comms people in think tanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You can also attend one of the many free meetups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to be quick off the mark to get a ticket for two of the most popular meetups, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NFPtweetup&quot;&gt;NFP Tweetup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://barcampnonprofits.com/&quot;&gt;Barcamp NFP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalcharities.org/&quot;&gt;Digital Charities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/digitalFRforum&quot;&gt;Digital Fundraising Forum&lt;/a&gt; both run really good workshops, focusing on a different topic each time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Charitymeetup?src=hash&quot;&gt;Charity Meetup&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/London-Charity-Workers-Meetup/&quot;&gt;London Charity Workers Meetup&lt;/a&gt; are networking events attended by all parts of the charity sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://open-charity.org/&quot;&gt;Open-Charity&lt;/a&gt; is specifically for charities using open source software. &lt;a href=&quot;http://attending.io/events/drinkingaboutmuseumssept2014&quot;&gt;Drinking About Museums&lt;/a&gt; has more of a museumy angle but is open to all sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prize for the meetup with the best/worst name goes to &lt;a href=&quot;http://charitychap.com/slamdunc/&quot;&gt;SLAMDUNC&lt;/a&gt;, the South London Area Mega Digital Unconference (although there hasn’t been one of these since March 2015). &lt;a href=&quot;http://socialmediaweek.org/london/&quot;&gt;Social Media Week&lt;/a&gt; in London each September is also worth checking out as it has had some great charity-specific events in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can afford to pay a little bit of money to attend a conference, workshop or seminar, check out the programmes of events run by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charitycomms.org.uk/events&quot;&gt;CharityComms&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/events-and-training/iofevents/&quot;&gt;Institute of Fundraising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benchmarking has grown loads in the last few years&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you love your data and you want to know if your comms and campaigns are actually performing well in comparison to other organisations, you need to take part in one of the benchmarking projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most ambitious of the lot is probably the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charitycomms.org.uk/charitycomms-digital-benchmark&quot;&gt;CharityComms Digital Benchmark&lt;/a&gt;. It combines Google Analytics data with survey responses to build a detailed snapshot of charities’ performance online, although it’s not . There are other surveys I’ve taken part in over the years on specific subjects like email or social media. Keep your eye on Twitter and the forums and you’ll hear about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of these, the full results are only available to the participating organisations, so you have to give a little to get something back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re a friendly lot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who do similar jobs to you at other nonprofit organisations actively want to help you succeed. We have a vibrant, open community of digital professionals, and if you engage with it you’ll find that you get a lot out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Missed anything?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m bound to have forgotten a particular group or event, so I apologise now. Tweet me at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jiggott&quot;&gt;jiggott&lt;/a&gt; and I’ll add yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally posted August 2014, updated March 2016.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Charity/Digital" /><summary type="html">Photo by Jeffrey Zeldman on Flickr
Unless you work for one of the larger non-profits, the chances are you’re in quite a small digital team. In fact, it might just be you managing digital communications for your organisation.
It’s all too easy to find yourself trapped in a little digital bubble - you’re the only expert in this area, you don’t have other people with whom to bounce ideas around, people who’ll send you links to interesting campaigns or invitations to new sites which are only just in beta. What you lack is people who’ll challenge you, help you learn more, hone your skills and become better at your job.
Luckily though, the not-for-profit sector is the friendliest and most sharingest place I’ve ever worked. Your peers in other organisations want to share what they’re doing, and hear about what you’re doing and offer feedback. They’ll suggest tools or contacts or suppliers who can help you. Very often they’ll even share their data so you can benchmark how you’re doing.
Yes, charities compete with one another for donations but there’s a feeling among us that because we’re all working for the greater good we want to help one another out. And if everyone maintains that attitude it can only benefit the sector as a whole.
So, where to find your counterparts in other organisations…?
The first place to look is Twitter
They are all over Twitter. Find @howardlake, follow him, then look at his Charity Digital and Social Media list - there are more than 300 people on that list who do similar jobs to you and who LOVE to tweet about it.
Next, join some forums
The Digital Fundraising Forum and CharityComms Heads of Digital LinkedIn groups are both very active, as is probably the longest-standing online group for us people: the Charity Webmasters Forum Yahoo Group.
The Institute of Fundraising has regional groups which are great places to network, and the Insight and Technology special interest groups are of particular relevance to our discipline.
Depending on your interests, you may want to check out eCampaigning Forum, a worldwide community of people using digital for campaigning, or WonkComms, a blog/group/Twitter account for comms people in think tanks.
You can also attend one of the many free meetups
You have to be quick off the mark to get a ticket for two of the most popular meetups, NFP Tweetup and Barcamp NFP.
Digital Charities and Digital Fundraising Forum both run really good workshops, focusing on a different topic each time.Charity Meetup and the London Charity Workers Meetup are networking events attended by all parts of the charity sector.
Open-Charity is specifically for charities using open source software. Drinking About Museums has more of a museumy angle but is open to all sectors.
The prize for the meetup with the best/worst name goes to SLAMDUNC, the South London Area Mega Digital Unconference (although there hasn’t been one of these since March 2015). Social Media Week in London each September is also worth checking out as it has had some great charity-specific events in the past.
If you can afford to pay a little bit of money to attend a conference, workshop or seminar, check out the programmes of events run by CharityComms and the Institute of Fundraising.
Benchmarking has grown loads in the last few years
If you love your data and you want to know if your comms and campaigns are actually performing well in comparison to other organisations, you need to take part in one of the benchmarking projects.

It&amp;rsquo;s the new cri de coeur for teams who think they&amp;rsquo;re different from the rest of the organisation, and who feel that the existing comms aren&amp;rsquo;t reaching their audience or generating the donations, signups or registrations they require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to roll your eyes and think &amp;ldquo;here comes another one&amp;rdquo; when someone asks for their own Twitter account, but every now and then it&amp;rsquo;s a genuinely good idea. So how do you work out if the latest request is silly or sensible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of last week (when I had three separate Twitter requests from three different teams) I ask them to fill in a little form I put together. This serves four purposes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It filters out the people who don&amp;rsquo;t want to invest any time in actually getting their Twitter account off the ground (they&amp;rsquo;re terrible clients anyway).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It gives people an idea of the effort and responsibilities involved in creating and maintaining a successful Twitter presence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It gets people to think about topics they probably haven&amp;rsquo;t considered, like software, passwords and training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It provides you with the information required to make a judgement about whether they require a separate Twitter account and what support they might need.&lt;/li&gt;

Leaders need to equip themselves and their teams with enough knowledge to be able to make business-critical decisions about investment in digital.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My favourite bit of social change</title><link href="https://jameshiggott.co.uk/2013/my-favourite-bit-of-social-change/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My favourite bit of social change" /><published>2013-02-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2013-02-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jameshiggott.co.uk/2013/my-favourite-bit-of-social-change</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jameshiggott.co.uk/2013/my-favourite-bit-of-social-change/">&lt;p&gt;I go through Elephant and Castle Shopping Centre every now and then, frequently to catch a late train back to Herne Hill. It’s not a very pleasant space – it’s dirty, dimly lit, empty and more than a bit seedy. I’m not surprised they’re knocking it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some good things about it of course – Mamuska is a good Polish restaurant and the bowling alley on the top floor does proper bowling instead of drinking, dancing and karaoke with a bit of bowling on the side – but only the helpless nostalgics will be sad to see it go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some time last year though, it changed. Groups of people (the youth!) started hanging around inside the building. There was a low-level murmur of chit-chat and excitement and the unmistakable sound of ball pinging off bat, onto table and onto bat again (or floor). Someone had installed some table tennis tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tables were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportengland.org/about_us/our_news/table_tennis_streets.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paid for by Sport England&lt;/a&gt; and started appearing in London in 2010 as part of their attempt to get more people playing sport regularly. An increase in ping pong is not, I expect, how most people would have interpreted that particular bit of Olympic legacy but it is a sport, and an Olympic sport at that. It’s also something that pretty much anyone can do and have fun while doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sport England was responsible for getting 1,000,000 more people playing sport three times a week and it was way off target, so much so that they scrapped their old target and set a more achievable one. They still needed a quick win though, and what better than to install some tables, equip them with bats and balls and then sit back and count the participants? Ping!, the organisation behind the tables, believes that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportengland.org/media_centre/press_releases/ping_results.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;30,000 people played on average four times each&lt;/a&gt; (during an unspecified period using not-very-rigorous methods for counting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it matter if the motivation behind them is a tiny bit cynical though? The important thing is that they injected some fun into the capital. Most of them were put in already-fun, Hipster-friendly spots around east London like 93 Feet East, Arnold Circus and London Fields but they were also installed in quite rough locations like Haggerston Park and Camberwell Green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the Ping! project has run its course many of the tables were sent elsewhere, to places like Elephant and Castle shopping centre. As I walked through there today on my way home from band practice two young men (one short, one tall) were playing a very intense game while half a dozen others looked on and waited their turn. Do they play winner stays on? I don’t know - I had a train to catch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those table tennis tables have brightened up a dark little corner of London. They bring people together, they make places more friendly, they increase participation in sport and they helped make a frankly depressing place a little more joyful. I hope when the shopping centre goes a new home is found for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I’m pleased to see that Ping! has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportengland.org/about_us/our_news/ping_nominated_for_sport_indu.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nominated for Sports Participation Event of the Year&lt;/a&gt; in the Sport Industry Awards 2013.

Topics ranged from social media to the 21st century to mobile to volunteering to in-mem giving. Here are eight things I learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Most people haven’t seen a good Vine video yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked five people this question and only one replied in the affirmitive. Vine is very new so that’s not too surprising. Serendipitously, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LondonKirsty&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@LondonKirsty&lt;/a&gt; chose today to share her Storify collection of good charity Vines: &lt;a href=&quot;http://storify.com/londonkirsty/i-heard-it-on-the-grape-vine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I heard it through the Grapevine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. You can launch a campaign on Twitter before it goes out on posters, TV, etc&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what BHF did for the #hardandfast campaign with Vinnie Jones and the results were so successful they’d do it again like that. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DaraNasr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@DaraNasr&lt;/a&gt; for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. JustGiving encourages a share after every action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make a donation, set up a page, add content to your page, even edit your post-donation comment and JustGiving will ask you to share far and wide, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jon_bedford&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@jon_bedford&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. There’s a Facebook Page Manager app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works on iPhone and Android and it’s more powerful than the page management tools in their regular app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Lucy Buck from Child’s I (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/childsi&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;@childsi&lt;/a&gt;) is worth listening to&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only caught the first ten minutes of her talk but I got two gems from it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Giving love is just as valuable as giving time or money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storytelling 101: set up problem (beginning), offer way to help (middle), show result (end)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. &lt;a href=&quot;http://phonecount.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Phonecount.com&lt;/a&gt; is a very cool website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also very useulf if you need to convince people about the value of mobile. Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/barryoreilly&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@barryoreilly&lt;/a&gt; for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. It’s possible to have a mobile-only user journey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would involve an SMS or a donation SMS to start, regular outbound SMS comms and regular giving through your phone bill. Most user journeys will be mobile and something else but mobile-only is possible. Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/helenjpattinson&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@helenjpattinson&lt;/a&gt; for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. Don’t silo your in-mem supporters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They often want to do challenges or events in memory of someone, as well as funeral collections or donations in lieu of flowers. In fact, 38% of in-mem donors skip the funeral collection / flowers thing altogether. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tea_junkie&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Katie Simmons&lt;/a&gt; for that.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Charity/Digital" /><summary type="html">Today I attended Justgiving’s Impact through innovation conference.
